### Description

This is a simple encryption routine I call UXC. I made it for my game files. Please give it a try!! Try to crack the sample .txt file and if you can post what it says here :) I want to see how hard or easy this is to crack so I can update it. Enjoy! Please vote and let me know what you think so I can improve it.
